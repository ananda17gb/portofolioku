          "In today's digital world, many people wish to share their thoughts and ideas online, but creating a personal blog often requires technical skills or relying on third-party platforms that may not offer full control over the content. Existing solutions might be too complex for users who want a simple interface or too restrictive in terms of customization and ownership. This project addresses the need for a personal, user-friendly platform where I can easily manage my content without relying on external blogging services and also I can make it as my personal project.",

          "The blog is built using React for a dynamic, component-based frontend, which allows smooth page transitions and reactivity without full-page reloads. Tailwind CSS is used to style the components, providing a clean and customizable design that adapts to different screen sizes which I choose for faster development. And for the backend, Firebase is utilized for user authentication, database, and storage. Firebaseâ€™s Firestore Cloud handles the database, Firebase Authentication ensures secure login functionality for me as the blog owner and Firebase Storage as the storage I use for this project. The combination of these technologies provides a seamless experience for both the blog creator and the readers and giving me a somewhat easy development experience. And for the design I use Figma with existing online blog pages as a reference",

It is built using React and Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive frontend, and Firebase for the backend. What makes this project unique is the integration between Firebase Storage and Firebase Firestore Cloud. When I upload a song to Firebase Storage, the system automatically extracts metadata (such as song title, duration, the song's mp3, etc.) and saves it to Firebase Firestore Cloud, streamlining the process of organizing and displaying my music.",

          "For a hobbyist independent musician and aspiring software developer like myself, creating a music display website felt like a natural step. It allows me to share my music while also sharpen my development skills through new projects. Before building this site, I would typically upload my music to platforms like Instagram and SoundCloud, but having my own platform gives me complete control and the freedom to customize it however I like. While some may see this as an unnecessary effort, for me, it's a creative outlet that merges my passions for music and coding. This project simplifies music sharing by automating metadata organization and streamlining how I manage and display my work, without relying on multiple third-party platforms.",

While it simulates the process of placing an order, it is not (yet) intended for actual use at the restaurant. Instead, it was created as part of a final project assignment, where we were tasked with building an application that demonstrates the use of data structures, specifically a linked list. Although this version doesn't implement the linked list functionality, it has more features compared to the other versions of the project. The app mimics a food order management system used by restaurant cashiers, where the cashier selects orders and the details are saved in a database the restaurant can also add menu to the app database from the database. We built the app using Flutter for the frontend and integrated the Google Sheets API to serve as a simple backend database for storing orders and adding more menu.",

          "Many small restaurants, such as Arjuna Chicken, lack technical knowledge to implement digital food ordering systems to manage their orders efficiently. Although such systems are available commercially (and actually they use QRIS) they can be costly and somewhat complex for small businesses to adopt. This project aims to address this gap by providing a lightweight and simple food order management app that simulates the features of a professional system, making it easier for restaurants to visualize and manage their orders digitally without investing in expensive infrastructure.",

          "The mobile app was developed using Flutter, which allowed us to build a cross-platform application with a single codebase for both Android and iOS but we opted for Android instead of iOS because we know that the restaurant has more Android phones than iOS. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, allowing cashiers to select food items from a menu, adjust quantities, add menu and submit orders. Google Sheets is used as the backend to store and manage order and menu data. This is accomplished through the Google Sheets API, which integrates with the app to allow real-time updates of orders. The app also features basic order tracking and menu addition, where the cashier can review and modify orders and add any menu to the app. Although this version of the project does not implement linked list functionality, it demonstrates a functional food order management system with all the essential features.",

As you can imagine what a marketplace is and basically this website is just like Tokopedia of food. The website was developed as part of a group project for 'CCI The Hack' a student event hosted by the CCI student activity unit. The project followed a structured development process, including planning with Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and continued through to deployment. SunsetSnack was built using NextJS for the frontend, PostgreSQL for the database, Firebase Storage for managing media, Firebase Auth for user authentication, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Our team consisted of five members: one designer (Muhammad Aqeel Jabbar), two frontend developers (me and Arief Setiawan), one fullstack developer (Athila Ramdani Saputra), and one team member responsible for documentation and business management (Gavin Benjiro Ramadhan). Shoutout to all of us to finish this project even though in the end we didn't won but atleast we get a taste on how to work as a team on developing an application.",

Firebase Storage is integrated to handle media assets, such as product images, while Firebase Auth ensures secure user authentication and login. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, allowing for a clean and modern UI. Throughout the project, we adhered to a detailed planning process involving documentation such as Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and frequent team coordination to ensure smooth progress.

The project consists of well-defined subprograms to manage various game functionalities, including tile management, score tracking, and winner determination. Each tile in the game is represented by an object containing two sections, with a total of 28 tiles. The game is designed to enhance algorithmic thinking by employing various search and sorting algorithms, including sequential and binary search, as well as Selection Sort and Insertion Sort for data organization. We used Go as the programming language of choice to make this game.",

The program employs arrays and custom-defined data types to manage tile states and player scores. Players can interact with the game by selecting and replacing tiles, restarting the game, and tracking scores. The program implements both sequential and binary search algorithms for locating tiles and includes Selection Sort and Insertion Sort to organize tile values for efficient gameplay. Additionally, the application tracks game statistics, allowing players to view their highest scores and overall performance, making it a comprehensive and engaging domino experience.",
